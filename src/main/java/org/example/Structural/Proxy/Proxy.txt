Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it
Surrogate
One reason for controlling accrss to an object is to defer the full cost of its creation and initialization until we actually
need to use it.

Participants
Subject(Graphic)
- defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy so that a Proxy can be used anywhere a RealSubject is expected.
RealSubject(Image)
- defines the real object that proxy represents
Proxy(ImageProxy)
- maintains a reference that lets proxy access the real subject. Proxy may refer to a SUbject if the RealSubject and Subject interface
are the same.
- provides and interface identical to the Subject so that a proxy can be substituted for the real subject
- controls access to the Real Subject and may be responsible for creating and deleting it
- Other responsibilities depend on the kind of proxy
    a. Remote proxies are responsible for encoding a request and its arguments and for sending the encoded request to the real subject in a
    different address space
    b. Virtual proxies may cache additional information about the real subject so that they can postpone accessing it. Eg: ImageProxy
    c. Protection proxies check that the caller has access permisssions required to perform a request
