Class Creational
Define an interface for creating an object.
But let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses

Virtual Constructor

Motivation
Frameworks use abstract classes to define and maintain relationships between objects.
A framework is often responsible for creating these objects as well.

Applicability
A class can't anticipate the class of the objects it must create
A class wants subclasses to specify the objects it creates
Classes delegate responsibility to one of the several helper subclass and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper
subclass is the delegate

Product
ConcreteProduct
Creator
ConcreteCreator

Creator relies on the subclass to define the factory method so that it returns an instance of the  appropriate concrete product
