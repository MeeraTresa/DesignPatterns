Object behavioral
Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you paramterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests
and support undoable operations

Also known as transaction, action

Encapsulating invocation

The command pattern allows you to decouple the requester of an action from the object that actually performs the action

Participants

2. ConcreteCommand
    - defines a binding between a Receiver object and an action
    - implements Execute by invoking the corresponding operations on the Receiver
3. Client
    - Creates a Concrete Command object and sets its receiver
4. Invoker
    - Asks the command to carry out the request
5. Receiver
    - Knows how to perform the operations associated with carrying out a request. Any class may serve as a receiver
